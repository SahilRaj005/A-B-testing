# A/B Testing Analysis
This project focuses on A/B testing analysis to evaluate the performance of a test group against a control group. The goal is to determine whether a proposed change leads to significant improvements based on statistical metrics.

Interpret A/B test results and make data-driven decisions.

Explore other statistical tests for robustness.

Build predictive models based on test results (if needed).
